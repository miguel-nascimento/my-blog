Hey, I'm @miguel-nascimento!

Sometimes Shiroikami, I need to start using my nickname everywhere...

I'm a SWE at [Blockade Games](https://blockade.games/), currently working on [Neon District](https://neondistrict.io/).

In this blog, you can expect some posts about Types and Interpreters.

I'm interessed in:

- Software Engineering (Typescript, Rust, React)
- Functional Programming (OCaml, Haskell, Kind2)
- Type Theory
- UI/UX

Currently studying [Lambda Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_cube) and [Type Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory), trying to fit some contribs into [Kind2](https://github.com/Kindelia/Kind2): a pure functional, lazy, non-garbage-collected, general-purpose, dependently typed programming language.
