Hey, I'm @miguel-nascimento!

Sometimes Shiroikami, I need to start using my nickname everywhere...

I'm a SWE at [Blockade Games](https://blockade.games/), currently working on [Skybox](https://skybox.blockadelabs.com/).

In this blog, you can expect some posts about Typescript and NixOS stuff, but I'll try to write about type theory too.

I'm interessed in:

- Nix and NixOS
- Typescript
- Functional Programming (OCaml, Haskell, Kind2)
- UI/UX
- Type Theory
